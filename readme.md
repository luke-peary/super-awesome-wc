# SuperAwesome Web Components

This is a small (but growing) component library, leveraging Stencil
This is a starter project for building a standalone Web Component using [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/).

## Getting Started

To start building a new web component using Stencil, clone this repo to a new directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luke-peary/super-awesome-wc.git
cd superawesomewc
```

and run:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

You can then add the available component to the index.html file to see what they look like, or import the whole package into your project to start using them.

## Installing package

```bash
yarn add superawesomewc
```
